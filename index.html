        <h2>What is RPA?</h2>
        <p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is a form of business process automation that is based on software robots (bots) or artificial intelligence (AI) agents.[1] It is sometimes referred to as software robotics (not to be confused with robot software)is a technology that uses software robots to automate repetitive tasks and processes in business operations. RPA bots can perform tasks such as data entry, data extraction, form filling, and more, freeing up human employees to focus on more strategic and value-added activities.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of RPA</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased Efficiency</li>
            <li>At times, companies need the ability to perform processes faster to help meet above-average demand. Workflow automation software increases productivity by increasing the speed and accuracy of your business processes, and by scaling automated processes within your organisation. An increase in productivity means a greater ability to serve and grow your organisation and customer base.</li>
            <li>Error Reduction</li>
            <li>RPA can be programmed to perform tasks like data collection from various sources, such as transaction logs, databases, or financial records. By automating these tasks, the process becomes more efficient and less error-prone.</li>
            <li>Cost Savings</li>
            <li>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is poised for tremendous growth. In 2020, the global RPA market was worth $1.23 billion. By 2030, that figure is projected to be $13.39 billion, a growth factor of more than 10. And when you look at the benefits of RPA, itâ€™s easy to understand why</li>
            <li>Enhanced Accuracy</li>
            <li>By automating calculations, RPA reduces the risk of human error and ensures consistent and accurate results. Additionally, RPA enables faster processing times, as it can perform calculations at a much higher speed than manual methods. This not only saves time but also improves productivity.</li>
            <li>Improved Compliance</li>
            <li>The compliance landscape is becoming increasingly complex with time. The constant changes in the regulatory environment, a lack of understanding of compliance measures, limited technology capabilities, and the uncompromising internet restrictions are the primary reasons why companies are looking for strong compliance measures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How RPA Works</h2>
        <p>RPA software robots are trained to mimic the actions of human users by interacting with applications and systems through the user interface. They can work 24/7 and are highly adaptable, making them ideal for various industries and tasks.</p>
